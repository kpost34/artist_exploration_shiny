# Artist Exploration App

An interactive R Shiny application for exploring visual art and artist information using machine learning and data from The Met’s public API.

## Summary
This Shiny app includes three main components:  
1. **Artist Classification:** An ML algorithm attempts to identify the artist of a user-uploaded artwork image.  
2. **Artist Exploration:** Users can explore artists by nationality and style, read short bios, and preview selected artworks.  
3. **Guess the Artist Game:** A game where users compete against an ML algorithm to identify the artist, using artwork and metadata (depending on the difficulty level).  

The app is built using a modular design and retrieves images and metadata from [The Met’s public API](https://metmuseum.github.io/).

**Note:** Development on this project was highly intermittent as I prioritized other commitments.
